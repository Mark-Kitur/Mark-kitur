**Hi, I'm Mark Kimutai Kitur**
Mechatronic engineer and data scientist focusing on robotics, embedded systems, and AI-driven automation. I develop end-to-end intelligent systems that integrate hardware, software, and machine learning.

**Embedded Systems Development**

I build and deploy real-time systems using microcontrollers and single-board computers. My experience includes:

    •	Bare-metal C development for microcontrollers (ATMega328P).
    •	Communication protocols: I2C, SPI, USART.
    •	Timer configuration, PWM generation, and ADC sampling.    
    •	Hardware-software integration for sensing, actuation, and control loops.    
    •	Deployment of ML models on ESP8266, Raspberry Pi, and other constrained devices.    
    •	Embedded automation modules implemented in C .

**AI, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering**

I work across modern and traditional AI systems, including:

      •	Transformers and large-sequence models.    
      •	Computer Vision pipelines for detection, classification, and tracking.    
      •	Traditional Machine Learning (SVMs, Random Forests, clustering, regression pipelines).    
      •	NLP systems (Seq2Seq models, attention mechanisms, language modeling).    
      •	Deployment of models on:    
              •	Render      
              •	Raspberry Pi      
              •	ESP8266      
              •	Web backends running Ruby
